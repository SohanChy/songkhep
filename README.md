Songkhep - A Bangla Text Summarization Engine

Author: Sohan Chowdhury 

Input a long bangla news article/text, and Songkhep will try to give you a short summary in less than 8 sentences. 
The modified combination of textrank and lexrank algorithm is still in its infancy, currently cosine similarity is combined with df-idf for graph weights, I hope to try a eigenvector approach soon. The output may not be as good as you expect. 
The algorithm is raw here, so no html parsing is done, please paste only plain text.
